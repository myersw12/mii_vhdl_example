10/100 Mb/s Ethernet
<br>By: Colin Durocher, Jeffrey Spiers
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><b><u>Introduction</u></b>
<p>This document briefly introduces the IEEE 802.3u MII standard and provides
fully functional VHDL source code for interfacing with an MII-based transceiver.
While the provided code could potentially be used in a 100 Mb/s implementation,
a few minor changes would have to be made.&nbsp; This design has only been
simulated and physically tested at 10 Mbit/s.
<p>Medium-Independent Interface (MII) is the IEEE standard interface between
the MAC (controller) and PHY (transceiver) layers of a 100 Mbit/s Ethernet
implementation, defined in the IEEE 802.3u standard.&nbsp; It is a 4-bit
wide parallel interface.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>Signals</u></b>
<p>The MII standard defines the following signals:

</table>

<p>Note that no guarantees are made about the phase relationship between
TXCLK and RXCLK.
<p>All the above signals, save MDIO, MDC, RXER, and TXER are defined as
inputs or output to the Ethernet module provided below.&nbsp; RXER and
TXER are not needed for a 10 Mbit/s implementation.&nbsp; MDIO and MDC
are not needed in a minimal implementation (such as the one provided in
the Ethernet module below) because the transceiver registers have convenient
default values.&nbsp; The Ethernet module instantiates various components
defined in eth_pkg.vhd.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>Receiving Data</u></b>
<p>The 802.3u standard indicates that the data received on the RXD[3 downto
0] data lines is properly bit-aligned, meaning that each 4-bit nibble is
either the lower 4 bits or upper 4 bits of a transmitted byte of data.
The lower 4 bits are received first, then the upper 4 bits. For example,
if the following nibbles (in hexadecimal) were received: "8", "9", "A",
"B", the bytes transmitted were "0x98" and "0xBA".
<p>The format of Ethernet frames is described in an <a href="http://www.ee.ualberta.ca/~elliott/ee552/studentAppNotes/1998f/ethernet/ethernet.html#format">earlier
student application note</a>. Essentially, the frame begins with 15 consecutive
"0101" preamble nibbles, followed by a "1101", then the data. The MII standard
does not specify how many of the 15 preamble nibbles will appear at RXD[3
downto 0]. In order to receive data, the MAC must wait for RXDV to be high
and RXD[3 downto 0] to be "1101". The nibble after "1101" is the first
valid data nibble. Specifically, it is the low 4 bits of the first byte
of the destination MAC address of the Ethernet frame. Refer to the previously
mentioned student application note for more information on the Ethernet
frame format.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>Transmitting Data</u></b>
<p>Data appearing on the TXD[3 downto 0] lines is transmitted when TXEN
is high. The least significant 4 bits should be sent before the most significant
4 bits for each byte. To transmit 0xB8, for example, the nibble "8" should
be sent, then "B".
<p>Before any data can be sent, the MAC is responsible for first transmitting
a valid preamble and start-of-frame delimiter (15 x "0101" + "1101"). In
order for the Ethernet frame to be valid, TXEN must remain high for the
entire duration of the frame, which means the data appearing at TXD[3 downto
0] must be ready on every TXCLK cycle (400ns clock period).
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>Ethernet Module</u></b>
<p>The Ethernet module that we wrote provides an even simpler interface
to an MII transceiver. The intention of our module is to provide transceiver
input/output synchronisation, byte-wide communication, and preamble generation.
<p><i>Signals</i>
<p>The Ethernet module has two sets of signals, the MII signals and the
internal interface signals. The MII signals used are a subset of those
described in the standard, because for most Ethernet implementations, some
of the signals are unnecessary. The MII signals we use and the corresponding
VHDL signal name are given below:
<br>&nbsp;

</table>

<p>The signals provided to the designer are the following:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER WIDTH="600" NOSAVE >
<tr>
<td><b>VHDL Signal</b></td>

<td><b>Description</b></td>

<tr NOSAVE>

<td>System clock. Must be 2.5 Mhz for proper 10Mbit operation, or 25MHz
for 100 Mbit operation.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>reset</td>

<td>Active high asynchronous reset</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>sync_clk</td>

<td>Synchronising clock, used to synchronise <i>rxclk</i> and <i>txclk</i>
to the system clock, <i>clk</i>. Should be 10x the frequency of the system
clock</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>rxdv</td>

<td>Indicates a byte of data is ready to be read</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>rxdata(7 downto 0)</td>

<td>Byte of received data</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>txen</td>

<td>When this signal first goes from low to high, a preamble is generated
and transmitted. 8 byte times later, bytes are read from txdata(7 downto
0) and transmitted. Transmission ceases when txen goes low.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>txdata(7 downto 0)</td>

<td>Byte of data to be transmitted</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>drop</td>

<td>Indicates the current frame should be dropped.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>These signals are all clocked on the <i>clk</i> signal, with the exception
of the asynchronous reset and the synchronisation clock.
<p>An important limitation of the ethernet module is that bytes must be
sent only every second clock cycle. This is simply because Ethernet transmission
is only 4 bits/clk, so bytes can be transmitted only every 2 clock cycles.
